# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API


## Title of the App

Social Network API


## App Description

The app was created to become a social network api. It allows the user to create an account with an email address. It also allows the user to add friends and they would then become mutual friends.
There is also the option to remove friends as well, but it will not result in the removed friend being removed as a user as well. The user is also allowed to make "thoughts" and they have the option to
create reactions to the created thoughts. Both the thoughts and reactions can be deleted as well.


## Installation Instructions

You will need to run npm i to install the node modules, as well as create an env file if you are using MongoDB Atlas. This will allow you to connect to the URI.


## App Usage

The app can be used to model out a possible social networking website for future creation.
